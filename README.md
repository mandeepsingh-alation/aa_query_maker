# Alation Analytics: Object Query Maker

## Purpose

This utility takes in the field_id and field_type value for each property of an Alation object stored in Alation Analytics (V R6 and below) and produces a complete query. Once you run the code, the query will automatically be added to your clipboard. All you need to do is paste it into compose.
